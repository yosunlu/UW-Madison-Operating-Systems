    - Implement essential shell functionality
4. **xv6: Stride Scheduling**
    - Gain familiarity with the xv6 codebase.
    - Learn to implement a stride scheduling algorithm.
    - Visualize the scheduling behavior through graphing.
5. **xv6: Copy On Write Fork**
    - Gain familiarity with xv6 memory management.
    - Implement an efficient copy-on-write fork.
    - Utilize debugging techniques to verify implementation correctness.
6. **Parallel Sorting**
